They're making sure we know that penalty went in with their snazzy graphics. &amp;quot;Oh yes, it was a goal,&amp;quot; fumes Mark Lawrenson on the BBC. &amp;quot;What a load of rubbish!&amp;quot; He's been in splendidly misanthropic form this evening. He'll be slagging off Twitter next - and don't get him started on Tinder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:30:42.228+01:00"&gt;8.30pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;30 min: &lt;/b&gt;Winning that penalty hasn't stopped the Brazilians from getting on Costa's case. Poor guy. His own countrymen and they hate him!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:29:53.639+01:00"&gt;8.29pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xabi Alonso wasn't going to miss this. He steps up and hammers a perfect penalty low into the bottom-right corner with his right foot. Cillessen guessed correctly but he was never going to reach that - it was struck too firmly. Now Holland really will be rueing that Sneijder chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:28:48.857+01:00"&gt;8.28pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;25 min:&lt;/b&gt; Diego Costa, of all people, wins a penalty for Spain! It was as clear as they come, so for once there's no controversy, which hasn't been the case so far in this tournament. Costa was released on the left of the Holland area by a gorgeous pass from Xavi. He was in a similar position to his earlier chance and again he tried to duck inside - and this time he was caught by a trailing leg from De Vrij.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:27:01.749+01:00"&gt;8.27pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;25 min: &lt;/b&gt;Holland work the ball well down the left flank. The ball is hoicked high to the far post to Janmaat, who elects not to volley it and instead cushions the ball back to De Guzman, who miscontrols and then pick up a booking for a foul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:25:39.229+01:00"&gt;8.25pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;23 min:&lt;/b&gt; Xavi swings the corner into the middle from the left and Pique, unmarked and arriving at a fair old pelt, isn't miles away from making contact with the cross. But he can't rise high enough. &amp;quot;Robben has decided to take a 5 minute 'boot break',&amp;quot; says Michael Hood. &amp;quot;Is he allowed to have a cup of tea during this?&amp;quot; Yes, I neglected to mention that Robben was off the pitch for a bit while he fixed something in his boot. It looked like he was adjusting some tape around his ankle, so it was nothing serious. He's back on now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:23:45.841+01:00"&gt;8.23pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;22 min:&lt;/b&gt; More box-based intricacy from Spain. Iniesta pops up on the left, scheming, but he has little support until Silva arrives. Iniesta prods the ball to him the flag stays down even though Silva looked offside but it's all too tight and Spain have to settle for a corner. This is where they could do with an Andy Carroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:22:08.680+01:00"&gt;8.22pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;20 min: &lt;/b&gt;Spain are trying to walk the ball in. Xavi lofts a stunning pass over the Holland defence to Silva, who brings the ball down and then tries to roll it across to Costa for a tap-in. Unfortunately a Holland defender is in the way. &amp;quot;What are the brazillians chanting at Diego Costa?&amp;quot; says Elroy Lewis, mistaking me for a Portuguese speakler. &amp;quot;Do you know?&amp;quot; I'm guessing it's not repeatable on a family website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:20:29.215+01:00"&gt;8.20pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;18 min:&lt;/b&gt; Well, Costa has been heavily involved so far, but not much has gone right for him. This time he's slipped through down the inside-right channel by the darting Silva, but then blooters high and wide, the ball sailing off target by an impressive margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:18:57.956+01:00"&gt;8.18pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16 min:&lt;/b&gt; Of course, Busquets then has to get in on the act too and is soon making the most of a nothing challenge from Sneijder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:18:05.952+01:00"&gt;8.18pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;15 min:&lt;/b&gt; The charmless Nigel De Jong picks up where he left off in 2010 and flattens Busquets I know, I know with a preposterous elbow to the chest. What's this guy's problem? I suppose it could have been worse given his history, but he didn't even bother looking at the ball, he only had villainy on the mind. Surprisingly he escapes without a booking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:16:40.333+01:00"&gt;8.16pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13 min:&lt;/b&gt; The crowd cackles as a hesitant Diego Costa fails to take a chance to give Spain the lead. This time it was Holland's turn to give their opponents far too much space in front of their defence, poor Ron Vlaar left all on his own against Iniesta and Costa. Iniesta slid an inch-perfect pass to the left for Costa, who had time in the area. But instead of shooting straight away, he waited too long, trying to duck back inside Vlaar and score the perfect goal. Instead he got himself in a muddle and Vlaar was able to hold him up and then block his eventual shot. That's superb defending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:13:59.962+01:00"&gt;8.13pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12 min:&lt;/b&gt; Spain's defence is there for the taking. Cillessen boots a clearance deep into the Spanish half and it's flicked on by Van Persie, who was barely challenged. Robben was almost away but the ball ran through to Casillas. Paging Pique and Ramos! The game started 12 minutes ago!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:11:59.085+01:00"&gt;8.11pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10 min:&lt;/b&gt; Spain look to make Sneijder waste that miss instantly. Alonso sprays a laser-guided pass out to Iniesta on the left and he zigzags inside, drops a shoulder and then whistles one not too far over from 25 yards. &amp;quot;So FIFA/Brazil cannot sell out Spain vs Netherlands?&amp;quot; says Fraser 'Frase' Thomas. &amp;quot;Shocking.&amp;quot; That depends on what shocks you about Fifa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:10:31.282+01:00"&gt;8.10pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8 min:&lt;/b&gt; Wesley Sneijder wastes an excellent chance to give Holland the lead! Spain's defence was caught horribly square and with little pressure on Robben in the middle, he was able to slip a lovely pass through to the onrushing Sneijder, who's in the clear. He takes the ball in his stride but then shoots straight at Casillas, who easily pushes his tame effort away.Holland should definitely be in front. That was a poor effort from Sneijder, who really shouldn't have given Casillas a chance of saving that. Still, Holland will take encouragement from how easily they carved Spain open there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:08:13.295+01:00"&gt;8.08pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7 min: &lt;/b&gt;Vlaar boots a pass forward towards Van Persie, who backs into Pique and manages to wriggle away from him. However he forgets to bring the ball under control and Azpilicueta is able to head back to Casillas, who remembers not to chuck it into his own net. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:07:07.824+01:00"&gt;8.07pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5 min:&lt;/b&gt; Right, they really don't like Diego Costa. He's being barracked whenever the ball is roughly in his vicinity, which has been often in these opening five minutes. It's going to be hilarious when he knocks Brazil out. Otherwise there's a strangely flat atmosphere in the stadium, the kind you'd hear in an Under-21 game. I'm guessing there aren't many fans from Holland and Spain present. Well done, Fifa! Well done!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:05:11.835+01:00"&gt;8.05pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4 min: &lt;/b&gt;Alonso shifts the ball out of his feet and then pings a pass over the top of the Holland defence, seeking out Costa, who's peeled away from Vlaar ominously. But the ball skips up off the surface, away from Costa - booed again - and through to Cillessen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:04:03.887+01:00"&gt;8.04pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3 min: &lt;/b&gt;Holland have settled nicely. They don't look intimidated by who they're facing. They're even sort of bossing possession. Spain are finished! &amp;quot;Do you get the impression that Bobby Keys didn't get the chance to watch i'm Alan Partridge?&amp;quot; says Matt West. Look, the 90s was a busy decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:02:52.489+01:00"&gt;8.02pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 min: &lt;/b&gt;Sneijder looks to burst on to a loose ball and set Van Persie clear but he's halted by a fine challenge from Busquets. The ball is worked up the pitch by Spain and towards Costa, who's booed by the Brazilian fans. They're not going to let this one go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:01:50.448+01:00"&gt;8.01pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peep! &lt;/b&gt;We're off! For some reason, both teams are wearing their away kit. Holland are in dark blue. Spain are all in white a tribute to England, I assume and they get the ball rolling. They're kicking from left to right in the first half. We wait 24 seconds for the first foul, Ron Vlaar dumping Diego Costa over from behind on the halfway line. &amp;quot;Is it true that 5 minutes before half-time the Dutch send one of their staff into the empty dressing room, just to get the argument started?&amp;quot; honks Justin Kavanagh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:55:40.447+01:00"&gt;7.55pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And here come the teams! &lt;/b&gt;Well, first the Spanish and Dutch flags. And then the teams! There are plenty of orange shirts in the crowd, some red ones too, but mostly the yellow shirts of Brazil. They do know Brazil can't play in every match, right? As the players walk out, the camera focuses on Andres Iniesta, who stands perfectly still, his head bowed and his eyes closed. What's he thinking about? Something mischievous, no doubt. &amp;quot;Considering they have appeared 3 times in World Cup finals and won none, I think the Netherlands should be allowed to put 3 half-stars on their shirts,&amp;quot; says Pangeran Siahaan, who might just be on to something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:48:03.898+01:00"&gt;7.48pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is tiki-taka. Try to keep your eye on the ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:46:28.230+01:00"&gt;7.46pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;Can we get an Over/Under on wrongly awarded and/or disallowed goals in this match?&amp;quot; says Michael Bertin.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not been great, has it? They should just let Howard Webb do every match. It would be a logistical nightmare, and he might be a bit tired after all the travelling he'd have to do, but he'd never make a mistake. In the time that he was awake, anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:38:22.831+01:00"&gt;7.38pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;Warning: this email mentions Manchester United,&amp;quot; warns Harry Tuttle.&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Is it better for Man Utd that the Netherlands do well at the World Cup, and van Gaal reports for duty at Old Trafford late, but with his &amp;quot;aura&amp;quot; intact, or is it better for Man Utd that the Netherlands bomb (qualification far from assured, and they play Chile last), meaning van Gaal shows up on time? It's got to be the first one, right?(Is it wrong I care about this? I'm not even a United supporter, although I have always had a soft spot for Ajax. Van Gaal's Ajax side - Finidi, Litmanen, young Davids, young Kluivert, young Kanu, young Overmars, young Seedhorf, the de Boer bros. - surely one of the great hipster teams. Be incredible to see if Van Gaal can import some of that Ajax academy goodness to England).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter. Manchester United are finished. They should just fold as a football club and concentrate on being a social media and marketing force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:27:31.954+01:00"&gt;7.27pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here are the teams. &lt;/b&gt;Spain start with Diego Costa, an actual 9. How uncouth. Holland are, as Van Gaal promised, playing 3-5-2, with Van Persie and Robben supported by Sneijder in attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spain:&lt;/b&gt; Casillas; Azpilicueta, Ramos, Pique, Alba; Alonso, Busquets, Xavi; Iniesta, Costa, Silva. Subs: Albiol, Martinez, Juanfran, Villa, Torres, Fabregas, Pedro, De Gea, Mata, Koke, Cazorla, Reina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:18:29.649+01:00"&gt;7.18pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;Amigo!&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; Look how much Michel Salgado doesn't want to be there. This series of videos on Richard Keys's inimitable blog - your key to sport are the highlight of this World Cup. The man is parody-proof. Is he doing it for a laugh? Or is he for real? Either way, this is a work of art, one deserving of a Bafta at the very least, a return to Sky Sports at most. One can only marvel at the cold terror about the prospect of 31 days of Keysian banter in the eyes of one producer, how Keysie's boss refuses to engage with him and the close-up of Andy Gray eating breakfast. I've never seen anything like it. Keep it coming, Richard, for you have gained one avid fan and if you touch just one person's heart over the next month, it will all be worth it this isn't a lie, I am utterly gripped and cannot wait to see if he figures out how to turn his camera round before the end of the World Cup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:08:44.259+01:00"&gt;7.08pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One reason for Spain to worry is the dismal record of the holders at the previous three World Cups.&lt;/b&gt; Italy finished bottom of a weak group four years ago, Brazil were a flabby disappointment in 2006 and France, who were also the European champions, didn't even score a goal in 2002. So that's that sorted then Spain are doomed. They might as well go home now. Hup Holland Hup!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:04:44.889+01:00"&gt;7.04pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As my colleague, Daniel Harris, points out, nostalgia features prominently in Mad Men. &lt;/b&gt;Although this brilliance was in the first series. So maybe I'm contradicting myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:52:22.708+01:00"&gt;6.52pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;While we wait,&lt;/b&gt; clever people at the Guardian have been putting together a video. And here's &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/quiz/2014/jun/13/world-cup-quiz-spain-holland"&gt;a quiz on Holland and Spain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:30:06.560+01:00"&gt;6.30pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good evening. &lt;/b&gt;At the start of every new Mad Men series, you don't have to look too hard to find people saying that it's lost its touch. Not as good as it was. They should have ended it years ago. It can never be the same again. How can you maintain those standards? Impossible. Should have gone out when they were out on top, like The Office, Fawlty Towers or One Tree Hill did, and now all they're left with are memories of the glory days and what are they worth? Nothing. They're worth. Yesterday's darlings, today's nobodies and to think that they were once such a big deal. Look how young they once looked! And now look. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabid nonsense, of course. It's still good, still better than the competition, and you can guarantee that the same people who were so critical of it at the start are the ones gushing about it at the end. But that's nostalgia for you. Humans are fundamentally conditioned to look wistfully to the past, when things were just &lt;i&gt;better &lt;/i&gt;when they are now, they just were. We can't help ourselves, we're only human. It's true in some cases the first series of Power Rangers was obviously the original and best, for instance, and they should never have come back for that extra season of Scrubs but not always.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/13/spain-v-holland-world-cup-2014-live-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663828/s/3b7a627c/sc/38/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119486469/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7a627c/sc/38/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119486469/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7a627c/sc/38/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119486469/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7a627c/sc/38/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119486469/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7a627c/sc/38/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119486469/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7a627c/sc/38/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119486469/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7a627c/sc/38/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119486469/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7a627c/sc/38/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119486469/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7a627c/sc/38/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/199119486469/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7a627c/sc/38/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/football/spain">Spain</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/football/football">Football</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport">Sport</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-2014-group-b">World Cup 2014 Group B</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-2014">World Cup 2014</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football">World Cup</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/football/holland">Holland</category><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2014 19:32:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/13/spain-v-holland-world-cup-2014-live-report</guid><dc:creator>Jacob Steinberg</dc:creator><dc:date>2014-06-13T19:32:58Z</dc:date><media:content height="276" lang="" width="460" url="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402687658316/1fcd5c84-ae5f-4e4f-8738-b9ffe5935383-460x276.jpeg"><media:credit scheme="urn:ebu">DAMIEN MEYER/AFP/Getty Images</media:credit><media:description>Diego Costa reacts during the first half.

Very poor. Speaking of which, up on 6, Mickelson misses a par tiddler, and he's back to -1. But are we that surprised? In 2012, he made nearly 93% of putts from inside five feet; last year, it was down to 80%; this year, it's 66%. Thanks to NBC television for those depressing figures, brought to you by the Guardian in living black-and-white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:22:45.816+01:00"&gt;3.22pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Na is making a move. &lt;/b&gt;His tee shot at 9 is a peach, pin high and 12 feet from the flag. He'll have a highly decent chance to move to -4. Up on 16, G-Mac wafts a weak shot out of the bunker, and fails to knock in the sizeable par putt he's lumbered himself with. He's back to -1, and now only two ahead of McIlroy, who nearly holed his chip from the back of the green and scrambled his par.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:19:03.514+01:00"&gt;3.19pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kevin Na is the first player to break from the peloton at -2 for a while. &lt;/b&gt;He manages this by chipping in from the side of 8. It's a delightful shot, thrown high into the air, biting on the putting surface, then rolling straight into the cup. Birdie! And he's got sole ownership of second place at -3. I wonder how nervous Martin Kaymer feels right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:15:41.730+01:00"&gt;3.15pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's just not clicking for the Northern Irish duo of Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell. &lt;/b&gt;Coming up 16, G-Mac's wood bounds off to the left of the green and in the bunker, while Rory hits his iron too far, and sees his ball trundle down the bank at the back. They'll both do well to save their pars at this &lt;i&gt;532-yard par four&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:12:12.099+01:00"&gt;3.12pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rose chips, and leaves himself a 15-footer uphill for par. &lt;/b&gt;It drifts left of the hole. Par. Bogey for Fitzpatrick, who slips back to +2, having dropped a stroke at 4 before. And then Mickelson steps forward to celebrate raking in a birdie putt, only to see the ball turn left at the very last minute. No sir. He stays at -2, and the last two holes have caused Lefty much frustration. Birdie for Poulter at 15, meanwhile, and he's suddenly -1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:07:33.325+01:00"&gt;3.07pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rose and Mickelson have to wait an eternity to send their second shots into the par-five 5th. &lt;/b&gt;Rose leaves his short, Mickelson pulls his to the right. Then Lefty duffs his chip. He needs to be making birdie at holes like this if he's going to plant seeds of doubt in Martin Kaymer's noggin. But that doesn't look like doing it. Meanwhile pars for Rory and G-Mac on 15, the former having missed to the front of the green, the latter going long. They'll be happy to have got up and down, and remain at +1 and -2 respectively. The wind's up. Kaymer's position is looking unshakable at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T20:00:21.572+01:00"&gt;3.00pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the love of Willie Anderson.&lt;/b&gt; Play is &lt;i&gt;slow&lt;/i&gt; this afternoon. It's ruining golf, this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:53:42.152+01:00"&gt;2.53pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;McIlroy opened with a bogey at 10, but he's just cancelled it out with birdie at 14, after clipping an approach pin high to 15 feet. &lt;/b&gt;He's +1, though not fizzing with his usual brio, it has to be said. You sense that Kaymer's stunning performances, both yesterday and today, have denied a lot of sails their wind. Kuchar gets up and down from the front of 15 for par.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:49:35.253+01:00"&gt;2.49pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speaking of Jimenez, he's just birdied 13 to move to +1. &lt;/b&gt;Rose, meanwhile, knocks in his birdie putt on 4, a much deserved reward for that approach. He's level par. And that puts him alongside his pal Ian Poulter, who dropped a shot at 11 but has just picked it up again at 13. No birdie for Spieth on 3, a terrible missed opportunity. Matsuyama doesn't miss out, though, and after his ostrich-like sand shot, puts away his birdie putt. He moves to -2. There's quite a group there now:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;-10:&lt;/b&gt; Kaymer (F)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-2: &lt;/b&gt;Koepka (F), D Johnson (F), de Jonge (F), Bradley (F), Na (6), Kuchar (5*), McDowell (5*), Mickelson (4), Todd (3), Matsuyama (3)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:44:38.238+01:00"&gt;2.44pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lefty can't drain his long birdie putt on 4. &lt;/b&gt;No surprise. Back on 3, Matsuyama splashes out from sand to give himself a decent chance of birdie, but Spieth duffs his effort from the bunker and faces a long birdie putt. Kuchar's tee shot at 15 falls off the front of the green. Nobody's making any early ground on Kaymer, who could be forgiven for slipping into Jimenez Mode right now: cigar ON. The conditions, to be fair to the players out there now, are much harder, with the greens cooking under the North Cackalaka sun, but then Kaymer had to put up with this yesterday afternoon, and he shot 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:39:12.547+01:00"&gt;2.39pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mickelson finds the centre of 4 with his approach. &lt;/b&gt;He's a fair distance from the flag, though, and doesn't look particularly thrilled with the result. Rose's approach, from a similar position, is right over the flag; he'll have a birdie chance from eight feet. Kuchar can't make his birdie at 14. But there's one for Brendan Todd at 3, and he joins the logjam at -2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:34:53.977+01:00"&gt;2.34pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kevin Na, at -2, attempts to tickle a birdie putt in on 5, but it stays out on the right. &lt;/b&gt;Matt Kuchar whistles his second into the heart of 14. He'll have a birdie chance there, hoping to move to -3. Speith was so close to joining the large chasing pack at -2 on the 1st hole, but he's just bogeyed 2 to drop back to level par. He's just sent his drive at 3 into a greenside bunker, though, so a fair chance to get up and down for birdie and grab it straight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:31:27.524+01:00"&gt;2.31pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ryan Moore, at +5, sends a wedge into 5.&lt;/b&gt; One bounce. Then the second bounce lands in the cup on the full! Slam dunk! God knows where that ball would have ended up otherwise. South Carolina? He's +3 now. The reigning champion Justin Rose - remember him? Remember Merion? - birdies 3 like Fitzpatrick and Mickelson before him. He's +1 and not out of this. He also looks like he's enjoying himself, perhaps having felt the pressure as returning champion yesterday. That's lovely to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:27:32.610+01:00"&gt;2.27pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The young Sheffield amateur Matthew Fitzpatrick is determined to have two final rounds as an amateur player. &lt;/b&gt;He turns pro once the US Open is done, so it'd be nice for him to stick around for the weekend, for old times sake. To this end, he's rattled in a long birdie putt on 3, and is level par for the tournament! What a prospect this young lad is. Ice in the veins, rather like that Kaymer fellow. Meanwhile his playing partner, Phil Mickelson, is on a charge! He birdies the hole too, and is suddenly tied for second place at -2!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:25:10.834+01:00"&gt;2.25pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The projected cut will see players at +6 and over head home.&lt;/b&gt; That would be Bubba bye-bye to the Masters champion Watson, Charl Schwartzel, Jason 'The Somnambulist' Dufner, Luke Donald, YE Yang, Darren Clarke, and Lee Westwood, who has started birdie-double bogey-bogey-birdie. Ludicrously, in other words. Also going home: the circus duo Hunter Mahan and Jamie Donaldson, who played each other's balls going up 18, before driving off in buggies with square wheels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:20:07.145+01:00"&gt;2.20pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;That leaderboard is preposterous, isn't it? &lt;/b&gt;Kaymer's 36-hole score of 130 is the lowest in US Open history, coming behind Rory McIlroy's 131 at Congressional in 2011, the 132 set by Ricky Barnes at Bethpage Black in 2009, and the 133s of Jim Furyk and Vijay Singh at Olympia Fields in 2003. Poor old Barnes and Singh didn't get to lift the trophy as reward for their troubles. Imagine making a mark like that, and still coming up short. Kaymer is a cool enough dude to cope with the pressure that'll be coming his way over the next 50-odd hours, but he'd be forgiven for getting the fear. If he's got a sizeable lead by the end of today, and fails to close this out, he'll not forget it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:13:51.469+01:00"&gt;2.13pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jordan Spieth is one dimple away from the perfect start at 1, but the putt dies to the right just before the hole. &lt;/b&gt;He remains at -1, just below the fairly static leaderboard. Matt Kuchar, who usually bothers these things come major time, has started strongly once again, with a birdie at 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;-10:&lt;/b&gt; Kaymer (F)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-2:&lt;/b&gt; Koepka (F), D Johnson (F), de Jonge (F), Bradley (F), Na (3), Kuchar (3*), McDowell (2*)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:09:47.092+01:00"&gt;2.09pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The crowd aren't giving up on Lefty, despite Martin Kaymer's position. &lt;/b&gt;An approach pin high at 2, and he rattles in the putt, giving the throng something to whoop and holler over. What an atmosphere! He's -1 now. Nine behind the lead, yes, but 16 holes to play for a man who loves nothing better than a birdie charge. Dafter stories have been written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T19:07:09.530+01:00"&gt;2.07pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who's going to make a fast start, then? &lt;/b&gt;Is anyone going to come at King Kaymer? I suppose Sergio's start qualifies as fast, doesn't it. A birdie, then a double bogey including a shank. McIlroy's bogus opening hole. Even the normally dependable G-Mac can't be relied upon: a birdie at his opening hole, the 10th, followed by a missed tiddler for par at the next. He had sole possession of second place for a second there, but now he's back in the pack. The most determined opening salvo has been launched by journeyman and headline-writer's dream Erik Compton. He's come straight outta the field to card three birdies in a row, at 2, 3 and 4, to move to -1. That's some start by a player who has a fascinating back story, to say the least: he's only played in one major previously, the 2010 US Open, but he's had &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; heart transplants. You wouldn't begrudge him a tilt at the prize, would you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:57:01.865+01:00"&gt;1.57pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oh, here comes Mr Murray.&lt;/b&gt; He's fed and watered and ready to take you through the afternoon. I'm off. Bye. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:54:07.485+01:00"&gt;1.54pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rose, Mickelson and Fitzpatrick all take par on 1. &lt;/b&gt;Meanwhile, McIlroy has had an abject start on 10. He's bogeyed it and drops back to +2. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:47:21.990+01:00"&gt;1.47pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Double bogey on 11 for Garcia!&lt;/b&gt; He was always going to struggle after clunking his second way out west. He began the day looking ahead of him. He'll be worrying about staying for the weekend now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:41:55.361+01:00"&gt;1.41pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Westwood birdies the first! Well done Lee.&lt;/b&gt; It would have been harder not to after his fine second shot. He's +4 now. Meanwhile, Rose, Fitzpatrick and Mickelson all find the fairway on the first. Mickelson will be hoping to putt better than he did yesterday if he has any hope of bridging even part of the the chasm between him and Kaymer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:37:25.842+01:00"&gt;1.37pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It doesn't get any better for Sergio.&lt;/b&gt; He chips out of the nasty stuff and watches in dismay as his ball takes a big bounce and then skedaddles across the green and right into the bunker to the left. Oh dear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:33:48.794+01:00"&gt;1.33pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oh Sergio! &lt;/b&gt;After making par on 10, he lands his tee-shot on 11 right in among the clumps of rough stuff to the right of the fairway. He addresses the ball, looks up towards the flag, and slices a shot that even I wouldn't be proud of, right back among the filth about 150 yards ahead of him and some way short of the green. That was a horrible connection. He's +2. He might not be +2 in five minutes, mind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:29:18.204+01:00"&gt;1.29pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lee Westwood, starting on +5, has done his chances of staying for the weekend no harm whatsoever&lt;/b&gt; with a glorious 2nd shot into the 1st green. He plops his ball within 8ft of the flag to give himself a great chance of making up a shot and creeping away from the projected cut, which is currently +6. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:23:05.277+01:00"&gt;1.23pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Danny Willett has recovered from the shakes and found his groove again&lt;/b&gt;. From off the green on 7 he takes a steady little backswing and putts a no-fear full-of-beans uphiller right into the centre of the cup. Plop! That's a birdie. And that's him back to evens. Well done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:18:31.993+01:00"&gt;1.18pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evening. &lt;/b&gt;Gregg here. I'm stepping into Scott Murray's golf shoes for a little bit so that he can calm down after that Martin Kaymer masterclass. How are you all anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:14:37.447+01:00"&gt;1.14pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time for me to take a wee break and a few mouthfuls of Golf Glove Grub. Taking good care of you in the meantime, Mr Gregg Bakowski!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:12:13.693+01:00"&gt;1.12pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bradley curls in his birdie putt, with large right-to-left break. &lt;/b&gt;He finishes with a second 69; he's -2 for the championship. Kaymer can't follow him in, but par will do. &lt;b&gt;He's signing for another 65, this one blemish free. He's -10 for the championship. &lt;/b&gt;That was an amazing round, a performance for the ages. He's halfway to his second major title and his first US Open. Well, more than halfway, you'd have thought. Still, two days to go, plus the chance someone will eat into this eight-shot lead this afternoon. Anyone fancy taking a run at it, then?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;-10:&lt;/b&gt; Kaymer (F)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-2:&lt;/b&gt; Koepka (F), de Jonge (F), D Johnson (F), Bradley (F), Na, McDowell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:05:09.356+01:00"&gt;1.05pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To the 9th, then.&lt;/b&gt; Keegan Bradley plops his tee shot into the heart of the green. Pin high, 12 feet from the flag. Very impressive. Kaymer would take that right now. And he follows Bradley's lead. Equally impressive. Two putts for a 65. One for a 64. What form he's in! And here's a stat he'll like: the last two majors have been won by the 36-hole leader, Dufner at the PGA, Bubba at the Masters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T18:00:47.001+01:00"&gt;1.00pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not one of Kaymer's best putts. &lt;/b&gt;From the front edge of the 8th, he leaves a 40-footer a good eight feet short. But he's left it uphill, so if you're going to misjudge it, that's the way to do it. Bradley's turn, and he rattles in a 25-foot par saver, and remains at -1. And then Kaymer steps up and knocks his par putt straight up the green, with a smidgen of left-to-right, and into the cup. He remains at -10. The par-three 9th is all that lies between him and a second 65 on the bounce. 65-65! At Pinehurst No2!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T17:54:10.877+01:00"&gt;12.54pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's all spinning out of control a wee bit for Danny Willett.&lt;/b&gt; Bogey at 5, his third in four holes, and he's dropped back to +1. Meanwhile a sense that the end of the round can't come quickly enough for Kaymer, his hot form notwithstanding. He's played a couple of loose shots over the last couple of holes, and he mishits his approach to 8 a little, pushing it to the right, the contact a little heavy. But his ball still squirts onto the front-right of the green. As bad shots go, leaving yourself two putts for par isn't the worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T17:49:08.681+01:00"&gt;12.49pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Birdie for Bradley at 7, his approach pin high to ten feet. &lt;/b&gt;He's -1 again. How he'll rue going out in 37; he's -2 coming back so far. A disappointing end to a disappointing day for Paul Casey, who sees his short par putt on 18 horseshoe out. He ends the day with a 75, and he's +5. To think he was -2 standing on the 8th, his 17th hole, yesterday. That missed tiddler might have cost him a ticket for the weekend, with the cut currently predicted to fall at +4. Scott meanwhile nearly rakes in a long birdie effort on 9, but settles for par and a 67. He's level par for the tournament, a fine round today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T17:44:08.660+01:00"&gt;12.44pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oh my goodness, Kaymer splashes to a couple of feet. &lt;/b&gt;He'll surely save par. That was such a delicate little splash, his ball clipped Seve style, the yolk off the white of the egg without spilling a drop. He stays at -10. &amp;quot;It's very, very impressive what Martin's doing,&amp;quot; laughs Brendon de Jonge, who is very pleased with the way he's playing himself, as he certainly should be, at -2 halfway. &amp;quot;He's definitely playing a different golf course to the rest of us!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T17:39:08.629+01:00"&gt;12.39pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A glimmer of hope for the field, as Kaymer makes another unforced error. &lt;/b&gt;He's tiring a little, perhaps. His approach to 7 is pulled into a bunker front left of the green. He's got very little green to play with, shortsided with extreme prejudice. If he scrambles par from here, everyone else may as well pack up and go home. It's all fallen apart for Fran Quinn, incidentally: after that fast start with birdies at 1 and 3, he's bogeyed 4 and 5, doubled 7, and dropped another at 12. He's +1 now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T17:35:36.384+01:00"&gt;12.35pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A long iron off the 7th tee for Kaymer, straight down the middle. &lt;/b&gt;Meanwhile Dustin Johnson polishes off his par putt for a one-under 69, his second of the week. He's done nothing wrong, give or take a missed tiddler! Johnson, Brooks Koepka, and Brendon de Jonge have all done nothing wrong! In fact, they've played stunning US Open golf on this pretty puzzle of a course, and yet they're eight shots off the lead right now! Eight shots! This is &lt;i&gt;astonishing&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;-10: &lt;/b&gt;Kaymer (15*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-2: &lt;/b&gt;Koepka (F), de Jonge (F), D Johnson (F), Na, McDowell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-1: &lt;/b&gt;Molinari (14*), Snedeker, Stenson, Kuchar, Todd, Spieth, Matsuyama&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T17:28:46.591+01:00"&gt;12.28pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaymer splashes out to a couple of feet. &lt;/b&gt;Mickelsonesque nerve on display as he took a full swing at that. He had maybe 30 feet to cover there. What touch! What confidence! What a player! A nerveless back-of-the-cup rattle for par, and he remains at -10. Up on 9, Dustin Johnson plays his last hole of the day. He gives himself a fine chance for birdie, his tee shot flying over the flag and landing 15 feet behind the cup. But he doesn't give his par putt enough juice, and it dies left. And on 18, De Jonge tidies up for par, putting his name to a second-round 70 which, added to his opening-day 68, leaves him at -2 in joint second place right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T17:23:56.100+01:00"&gt;12.23pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaymer makes a rare mistake!&lt;/b&gt; He lets his tee shot at 6 drift out to the right, and into a greenside bunker. A tough up-and-down from there awaits him. De Jonge faces a tough par scramble too, from the front of 18. His chip up the green ends six feet from the flag, no gimme. Bogey for Willett at 4. He's back to level par, having taken three to get down from close range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T17:18:51.798+01:00"&gt;12.18pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaymer puts his putt away without fuss.&lt;/b&gt; He moves to -10. This is phenomenal. He leads by eight shots right now, as de Jonge has dropped a shot on 17, while Johnson has failed to hole an eight-foot birdie putt on 8. Brooks Koepka has hit his approach at 18 pin high to six feet, and ratted in the birdie putt to sign for a 68. But they're all just - &lt;i&gt;just!&lt;/i&gt; - at -2. One or two of the afternoon starters is going to have to make a move, or this US Open could be as good as done and dusted by the halfway stage. Mind you, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jun/07/joy-of-six-us-open-golf"&gt;Arnold Palmer was seven clear of Billy Casper with nine holes to play in 1966&lt;/a&gt;, so let's count no chickens. You wouldn't bet all the chicks and the rest of the farm against Kaymer, mind, would you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;-10:&lt;/b&gt; Kaymer (14*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-2:&lt;/b&gt; Koepka (F), D Johnson (17*), de Jonge (17), Na, McDowell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T17:09:46.521+01:00"&gt;12.09pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaymer batters his second shot at 5 to the front of the green, then hits a 28-yard eagle putt to six feet.&lt;/b&gt; That's a fine effort, not least because six feet past the hole, and that ball's skittering off down the bank at the back. Is he about to move into that rarity for US Opens: double figures under par? Meanwhile birdie for Willett on 3, to move back to -1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T17:04:00.612+01:00"&gt;12.04pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Johnson misreads his putt from just off the front of 7, leaving himself well short and left.&lt;/b&gt; But he pops in a very missable par putt to stay at -2. Imagine having the game to do that, and missing a tiddler like he did on the previous hole. It's why we love watching him play. It's also why he's yet to win a major, despite having all the tools. The top of the leaderboard, then:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;-9: &lt;/b&gt;Kaymer (13*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-3: &lt;/b&gt;de Jonge (16)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-2: &lt;/b&gt;D Johnson (16*), Na, McDowell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T16:55:03.042+01:00"&gt;11.55am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dustin's binlid has flipped, an approach to 7 short of the green. A battle for par from there. &lt;/b&gt;Good work from Francesco Molinari, who rattles in a 20-footer on 4, and that's back-to-back birdies: he's -1 for the tournament. No word of Kaymer for a while: he's had to wait on the 5th tee for a quarter of an hour, that's why. He eventually takes out big Bertha, and batters a drive down the left-hand side of the fairway. It flirts with the scrub down the left, but stays on the tidy stuff. Just.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T16:50:01.544+01:00"&gt;11.50am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adam Scott is coming back. &lt;/b&gt;Birdies at 3 and now 5, and he's level par for the championship. He's -3 for his round today, the next best performance after Kaymer. De Jonge has second place to himself right now, and finds 16 in regulation, but leaves himself with a long two-putt for par.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T16:47:29.970+01:00"&gt;11.47am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dustin can't rake in his birdie effort at 6. &lt;/b&gt;And then he misses an 18-inch par putt! Dearie me. The toe of his putter was almost pointing back towards him when he hit that! What abject carelessness! He completely took his mind off that. Take no liberties, Dustin, this is Pinehurst No2 here. He's back to -2, and storming off the green, fuming. &amp;quot;The wrong ball carry on at 18 reminds me of the greatest golf scene in cinema history,&amp;quot; writes Simon McMahon. &amp;quot;James Bond v. Auric Goldfinger. Oddjob as caddy for the man with the Midas touch was something else too. The scene was filmed at Stoke Park which was close to Pinewood Studios. The film was released in 1964, the same year that Bond's creator and golf fan Ian Fleming died, shortly after having been made Captain Elect of Royal St. George's.&amp;quot; Stoke Park's a lovely course. The 7th was the inspiration for the original 16th at Augusta National, though big changes down Georgia way have made any comparison almost worthless these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T16:36:58.452+01:00"&gt;11.36am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brendon de Jonge isn't taking this lying down. &lt;/b&gt;A tee shot at 15 pin high, and he rolls in a ten-footer for birdie. He's got a share of second at -3, alongside Dustin Johnson, who also appears to be in the mood to give it a go, rather than die wondering. He fires a long iron into the heart of the lengthy par-three 6th, leaving himself a 20-footer that's uphill and makeable for birdie. Kaymer can't make his birdie putt on 4, the ball staying high on the right, but he taps in for par, and stays at -9. Can Dustin close the gap to five?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T16:30:51.748+01:00"&gt;11.30am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaymer drives his ball right down the middle of the long par-four 4th. &lt;/b&gt;He arrows his approach straight at the flag. It drops 12 feet in front of the flag, thinks about toppling back down off the green at the front, but stays put. He's got the ball on a length of string at the moment. Another birdie chance, an uphill putt he can have a trundle at. This is sensational golf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T16:28:11.029+01:00"&gt;11.28am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other thing is, nobody else is ripping up the course like Kaymer is doing right now. &lt;/b&gt;It's not as if set-up or morning conditions can be blamed. Kaymer is -4 today. The next best rounds today are -2, by Gary Woodland, Adam Scott, Kevin Stadler, Luke Donald and Lucas Glover, of all people. Ah, and Dustin Johnson, who has just birdied the par-five 5th to move to -3. Only six shots back! Eatin' into that lead!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;-9: &lt;/b&gt;Kaymer (12*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-3:&lt;/b&gt; D Johnson (14*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-2:&lt;/b&gt; de Jonge (14), Na, McDowell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-1: &lt;/b&gt;Koepka (15*), Willett (10*), Snedeker, Stenson, Kuchar, Todd, Spieth, Matsuyama&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T16:22:35.081+01:00"&gt;11.22am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaymer's eagle putt, then. &lt;/b&gt;It's a 30-footer down the hill, with a big left to right break. He overhits it, so although the line's good, it only breaks back a good five feet past the hole. He's left with an uphill birdie putt, though, and in it goes, with a gentle right-to-left glide. He's -9! Probably the time to consider the lowest marks in US Open history: Tiger Woods was -12 when he won the 2000 tournament, while Rory McIlroy ended on -16 in 2011. With the caveats that Kaymer could drop a few coming in, and one of the second wave of starters could card a low score later this afternoon, this is in danger of turning into a procession. What do the USGA do? Tighten the course up in the hope that Kaymer stops making birdies, and maybe starts sliding back? Thing with that approach is, it's going to be hard for anyone else to make up the shots. Hmm. Problems, problems, problems, the like of which haven't been seen in the States since &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRGCeM1enhw"&gt;the days of the Everly Brothers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T16:12:55.341+01:00"&gt;11.12am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donaldson, on 2 at +8, claps his approach to six feet.&lt;/b&gt; A wonderful shot, but don't smell his funny flower!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T16:11:31.725+01:00"&gt;11.11am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaymer has just driven the 3rd. &lt;/b&gt;Two putts, and he'll be -9, seven clear of the field. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Sky have just pointed out that, having just played the back nine twice, consecutively, those particular 18 holes added up to 63. Which, of course, is the lowest score ever carded in a major. It's not the same thing, of course it's not, by a long chalk, but it goes some way to illustrating just how well he's been playing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T16:01:49.036+01:00"&gt;11.01am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mahan, off the back of the wrong-ball debacle on 18, rakes in a huge birdie putt on 1. &lt;/b&gt;He's back to +3. A great effort, but don't smell his funny flower!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T16:00:24.097+01:00"&gt;11.00am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Willett can't make his birdie putt on 17. &lt;/b&gt;Par. Birdie for Adam Scott on 4, after he drove the green and missed an eagle rake by inches. He's back to +2. An eagle for Kevin Stadler on 13, though, as he pitches his approach six feet behind the flag and spins it back into the cup. He's suddenly only +5 now, and thinking about making the cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T15:57:02.158+01:00"&gt;10.57am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A staunch par saver for De Jonge on 12. &lt;/b&gt;He remains at -2, in second place, a mere six off the lead, Kaymer having traversed the 1st without fuss. That's something, though it's beginning to look as though one of the later starters will have to take a run at the leader. Quinn, at 7, putts his third up to the flag from off the green, but the ball rolls away back down the hill. He'll be dropping a shot there at least. Dustin Johnson saves par on 4 with an up and down from sand. Kaymer, in dreamland, finds the centre of 2 in regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T15:53:22.530+01:00"&gt;10.53am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;*MBM writer contines to shake*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T15:53:07.392+01:00"&gt;10.53am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A total farce has unfolded on 18,&lt;/b&gt; with Hunter Mahan and Jamie Donaldson playing each other's balls with their second shots! Dear oh dear. They only find out upon reaching the green, and have to make the walk of shame back. Donaldson was already having a complete shocker. He was -2 at the 17th tee yesterday, but double bogeyed that, and having carded 70 yesterday has continued to collapse. Opening bogeys at 10 and 11, another at 15, a triple at 17, and now this absurdity. This is the US Open you're playing here, chaps! Get with the program! Dear lord. Donaldson's round is shaping up to be one of the great komik kutz in golfing history, but at least the Welshman had already collapsed, so little is lost. Mahan was only +2, and still had a little hope. Double bogeys all round! All four clowns - Mahan, Donaldson, and the two caddies - have the decency to look extremely embarrassed as they scuttle away from one of the most famous greens in world golf &lt;i&gt;having done that&lt;/i&gt;. What will Payne Stewart be thinking if he's looking down on this nonsense right now? Imagine being Stewart's caddy if this had happened to &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;! &lt;i&gt;*MBM writer shivers with fear*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T15:42:55.637+01:00"&gt;10.42am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adam Scott was out in 33, but a bogey at 2, sending his third ten feet past the pin with a nudge from his greenside fairway wood, sets him back to +2. &lt;/b&gt;Willett looks to bounce straight back by sending a beautiful tee shot over the flag at 17 to eight feet. Paul Casey meanwhile is going along nicely: a birdie at 9 and he's playing par golf today, and par golf for the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T15:32:38.754+01:00"&gt;10.32am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaymer makes his par at 18, as you always knew he would. Ice in the veins. &lt;/b&gt;He really is a special player. That still might not be enough to win a US Open, of course, but he's won a PGA in a play-off, knocked in the decisive putt at a Ryder Cup, and pulled himself out of a tailspin to win the unofficial fifth major last month. He is something else. Meanwhile back on 5, Quinn drops another shot; on 16, Willett leaves a six-foot par putt up on the right; while up on 3, Dustin gets up and down from the bunker to birdie. The big man's in second spot now Kaymer's six shots ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;-8: &lt;/b&gt;Kaymer (9*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-2:&lt;/b&gt; D Johnson (12*), De Jonge (10), Quinn (5), Na, McDowell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T15:21:11.721+01:00"&gt;10.21am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dustin Johnson's second at 2 is arrowed right at the flag: &lt;/b&gt;he'll have a short birdie putt to move to -2. But he doesn't make it. He remains where he is. He's -1! But there's a chance for him to pick up a shot at the short par-four 3rd, where he's just plonked his tee shot into the bunker front right. That's where Fran Quinn nearly splashed out for eagle. Meanwhile up on 18, Kaymer's found yet another green in fuss-free regulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T15:17:53.290+01:00"&gt;10.17am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gary Woodland was one of the stars at Augusta this year, &lt;/b&gt;wheeching through the front nine in 30 strokes on the third day, before collapsing, if that's the word for a sub-70 round, to a 69. But what a whirlwind that was! Anyway, nothing quite so dramatic this morning, but this is a course that suits his big hitting and handy short game, and he's -3 through 7 this morning; coupled to the 72 he shot yesterday, that's him -1 for the tournament. Along with the leader Kaymer, this is the round of the day so far. But young Willett isn't far behind him: he's just hit his tee shot at 15 over the flag to three feet, and rolled in a gentle right-to-left birdie putt. He's -2 for the round, and the tournament, and is tied for third place on debut!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T15:12:20.219+01:00"&gt;10.12am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dufner in the bunker. &lt;/b&gt;And after one splash, he's still in the bunker. A second escape to four feet, but that's a bogey, and he's back to +3. Bradley leaves his putt three feet short, giving Kaymer a read. The leader doesn't quite make use of it, his ball caressing the left-hand side of the cup before staying out. Par. He remains at -8. But poor Bradley is back to level par, missing a tiddler for his three. If he's doing this with the belly putter anchored, what's he going to be like when the things are banned? You do worry for him. But putting's part of the game. If not &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T15:05:01.661+01:00"&gt;10.05am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bradley got up and down rather brilliantly from the bunker at 16, by the way. On to 17, where the leader Kaymer clacks a gorgeous tee shot pin high. &lt;/b&gt;Again, he's not gone right at the flag, which is front right and near the run-offs and some sand. But he's given himself half a chance of yet another birdie. Bradley follows him, outside Kaymer's ball by about five feet. Their playing partner Dufner has been drifting along at +2, but may not be there much longer, dumping his tee shot in the sand Kaymer and Bradley so cleverly avoided. Meanwhile trouble for Quinn at 4: he's off the green front right, and sends his putt ten feet past the hole. That's actually a decent effort from where he was, but the return putt doesn't go in. He's back to -3, and Kaymer is five shots clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T14:59:33.158+01:00"&gt;9.59am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaymer rakes in another birdie putt!&lt;/b&gt; From 35 feet away, he rolls in a beauty, and moves to -8. He's four clear of Fran Quinn at -4, and with De Jonge dropping a shot at 8, six clear of third place. This is beginning to look ominous. Nobody's ever going to be the boss of a course like Pinehurst No2, but Kaymer looks to be taking the perfect approach, playing it safe without being unambitious, going for the greens without being overly aggressive. Make a few putts, scramble well, and well looky here! This is sheer brilliance from the 2010 PGA winner and current Players champion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T14:55:38.186+01:00"&gt;9.55am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From 200 yards out in the centre of 16, Kaymer finds the heart of the green. &lt;/b&gt;He's playing sensible golf here: forcing nothing, knowing full well Pinehurst is prepared to bite, and grab a few of those shots back. Bradley, by comparison, has done well to get himself back into the mix at -1, but he blooters his tee shot into the scrub down the left, then wangs his second into the middle of a huge bunker to the right of the green. An up and down's no gimme from there. &amp;quot;Can't be just me that's decided to leave the garden to go all Pinehurst #2 to celebrate this event?&amp;quot; wonders Calum Lynch, taking an admirably romantic approach to rank indolence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T14:49:35.542+01:00"&gt;9.49am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is Danny Willett's debut at the US Open, and he appears fairly comfortable in his shoes.&lt;/b&gt; A level-par 70 yesterday, and now he's rattled a birdie putt right across the 13th green to move to -1. He's tied sixth for the championship at the moment. Not bad for a 25-year-old son of a Sheffield preacher. Hey, any old excuse ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T14:43:02.764+01:00"&gt;9.43am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;De Jonge is in bother down the right of 7, in the scrub.&lt;/b&gt; He can't find the green with his second, but clips a pitch up the green to five feet. He should save par. And that's what he does. On 2, Quinn drives into the bunker at the front of the green, then nearly holes the sand shot for eagle! Birdie will do, though, and he's alone in second place at -4! Kaymer meanwhile just can't be stopped: he splashes out gracefully to eight feet at 15, as good as he could do, really, then rolls in the par putt. Bradley knocks in a ten footer for birdie, meanwhile, his second in three holes. After an awful two-bogey start, he's back to -1. This is beginning to bubble up. It's an excellent US Open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;-7:&lt;/b&gt; Kaymer (6*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-4:&lt;/b&gt; Quinn (3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-3: &lt;/b&gt;De Jonge (7)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-2: &lt;/b&gt;Na, McDowell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T14:38:04.974+01:00"&gt;9.38am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The beauty of Pinehurst No2, pt XXXVIII: &lt;/b&gt;Ken Duke's tee shot at 9 rests against a clump of thick grass on the edge of a bunker. He's stymied from behind. Here's the picture from left to right: bunker-clump-ball-pin. He won't be able to get his club through the clump to hit the ball towards the cup. So he's got no option but to use the toe of his putter to tok the ball sideways and then back into the sand. Haw! And this is just delicious, because what happens next? Oh you know what happens next! He splashes out, and with three bounces plops his third shot into the cup! There won't be a better par all week. Brilliant! He remains at +3, but that's not really the point of this dispatch. You'd have a heart of stone not to be grinning like a buffoon after watching that palaver!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T14:33:12.505+01:00"&gt;9.33am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another poser for Kaymer, this time at the par-three 15th. &lt;/b&gt;He misses the green, dumping his ball in the bunker front right. With not much green to work with, that won't be an easy up and down. Seconds before, up on the same green, Louis Oosthuizen, at +1, saves par with a staunch ten-footer. Upon picking out his ball from the hole, he becomes the first man since the legendary Nick Faldo to perform that bandy-legged Oo-er-I'm-About-To-Collapse comedy stagger. Oh dear. He'll be saying things like &amp;quot;jeepers creepers&amp;quot; in interviews next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T14:25:46.375+01:00"&gt;9.25am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaymer in a little trouble here on 14. &lt;/b&gt;He seriously overbakes his uphill putt from 50 feet, and misreads it too. Unless he drains a 15-footer coming back, he'll be dropping only his second shot of this year's tournament, and the first since yesterday's par-four 7th. But what do you know! He makes it! That's the sort of saver that wins US Opens, worth as much - if not more, mentally - as those birdie rakes. The leaderboard, and look how spread out it's become already, given the logjam of yesterday afternoon:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;-7:&lt;/b&gt; Kaymer (5*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-3:&lt;/b&gt; De Jonge (6), Quinn (2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-2:&lt;/b&gt; Na, McDowell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T14:22:10.031+01:00"&gt;9.22am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adam Scott has finally come alive. &lt;/b&gt;A fairly mundane 73 yesterday, and three opening pars today, but he's just birdied 13 and 14, and suddenly finds himself at +1. You'd think he needs to post a low score today to have a chance in a tournament he's never really enjoyed; well, he's going about it the right way. Back on 14, Kaymer is able to get his ball out of the sand with a view to reaching the green. Which he does, just, though he's left with a long two-putt for par. Fran Quinn is only a turn or so away from a second birdie of the day, this time at 2. Meanwhile to illustrate how difficult these greens are, major winner Charl Schwartzel has just putted from the middle of the par-three 15th. A misread, and his ball breaks off to the right, and skitters off the front of the green. What a farce. Though it's lovely to see the pros struggle like rank amateurs, let's not ignore that fact. Schwartzel started the day at level par. He gets up and down for bogey, but that comes hot on the heels of bogey at 14 and double bogey at 12. He's +4 for his round through six holes, and +4 for the tournament. He'll have the heat on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T14:13:48.785+01:00"&gt;9.13am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaymer hasn't looked like he's in the mood to give the rest of the field a chance. &lt;/b&gt;But his drive at 14 drifts off into a bunker down the left of the hole, and he may need to take his medicine and chip out from that. In which case, a bogey will be the most likely outcome. Seeing we're discussing bogeys, here's Dustin Johnson failing to get up and down from sand on 16, and misreading a par putt dismally while he's at it. He's back to -1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T14:11:29.777+01:00"&gt;9.11am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bradley, who has done nothing all day, drains a 30-footer for birdie! &lt;/b&gt;That was one of those monsters that was going in from the moment it left the face of his putter, you just knew it. A beautiful stroke! And guess who goes to school on it? Martin Kaymer, that's who! The only worry about Kaymer's putt, from similar range in the middle of 13, is that he's not hit it. It's on line. But there's just enough on it, and it drops for his second birdie of the day! It really should be his third, but two will do, and he pumps his fist into the air, allowing a huge smile to spread across &lt;i&gt;der Bundescoupon&lt;/i&gt;. He's four clear of the field! Dufner rolls in his short birdie putt, by the way, it would have been a shame had he missed, on account of hitting the only decent approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T14:06:19.351+01:00"&gt;9.06am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another hole, another fine approach by Martin Kaymer.&lt;/b&gt; He's not playing the longest in this group, though with Dufner and Bradley in attendance that's hardly something to be ashamed of. So he's a fair way back, but he still arrows an iron into the heart of the green. This isn't in realistic birdie territory - though it's a half chance - but the main thing is, it's safe. For all that there may be scores out there this morning, this is still Pinehurst No2, and this is still the US Open. Dufner, by far the longest on this hole, lifts a wedge over the flag and gives himself a chance of birdie. Paul Casey and Jimmy Walker drop back after fast starts, incidentally, with bogeys at 2 and 13 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T14:00:00.530+01:00"&gt;9.00am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaymer won't worry &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; much about missing that birdie opportunity, though he's not in a position to be fussy quite yet. &lt;/b&gt;De Jonge's move up the leaderboard we already know about. But there are others. Dustin Johnson's just birdied 15 to return to -2, while the unheralded Fran Quinn has picked up where he left off yesterday: the 49-year-old carded a first-round 68, and he's birdied the opening hole today to move to -3. Here's the leaderboard on the hour:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;-6: &lt;/b&gt;Kaymer (3*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-3:&lt;/b&gt; De Jonge (5), Quinn (1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-2: &lt;/b&gt;D Johnson (6*), Na, McDowell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T13:56:21.413+01:00"&gt;8.56am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goodness me, Martin Kaymer really does look like the man to beat this week.&lt;/b&gt; He plays his second into 12, a green that's hardly unique with its small landing area and dramatic roll-offs. It's right at the flag, 15 feet from the cup. Maybe just 10 or 12. Notable that Kaymer was the first to play, having been the only member of the group not to attempt to blast the cover off his ball. Dufner is in the bunker front right, while Bradley, from the scrub down the right, is to the right of the Dufner Bunker. Not only does he have sand to traverse, he's also shortsided. What a puzzle. But in fairness he clips a superlative chip just over the bunker, his ball rolling about 12 feet past the hole. Not ideal in wider-picture terms, but about as good as he could have been from where he was. Kaymer steps up for his birdie putt. It's uphill, from 12 feet - but he misses it, the ball skating by on the right. He'll stay at -6. A chance spurned, after such a good approach. Bradley can't save his par; it's been a poor start; he's +1 now. Dufner splashes superbly to a couple of feet, from where he makes par, though only just, using all of the hole and blowing hard as he walks off considering the yips. Kaymer tidies up for par.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T13:46:00.393+01:00"&gt;8.46am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another birdie for Brendon de Jonge!&lt;/b&gt; He's in second place on his lonesome, having now carded back-to-back birdies, adding to his three at 3 with another at 4. He's -3, and three strokes behind Kaymer, who has just stroked a gorgeous tee shot straight down the middle of 12. Dustin Johnson has dropped a stroke, giving up that fast start: he's -1. As is Brooks Koepka, erstwhile leader of this tournament, who is at least unlike Johnson moving the right way: birdie at 15 for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T13:40:46.296+01:00"&gt;8.40am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slow play. Good lord. Doug H Sanders. Keegan Bradley takes an absolute age to play his second shot. &lt;/b&gt;He's just managed to stay on the fairway. He peers down it. Checks his ball. Assumes his stance. Steps back. Checks his ball. Peers down the fairway. Adjusts his glove. Steps back. Checks his ball. Steps back. Eventually he gets on with it - and leaves his approach ten yards short of the green. What was the point? It was a simple enough shot. Hurry up, for the love of God. Then he underhits the long uphill putt onto the green. He'll be left with a 12-footer for par. And he overcooks it. Back to level par. Dufner, by comparison, tics and twiddles a bit, but batters out of the scrub to the front of the green. He can't get up and down from there, but he's unfortunate with his putt, which fails to drop into the cup on the right despite flirting with the edge of the hole. He's back to +3. Kaymer meanwhile plays it a little too safe with his iron into the green, and leaves himself a long uphill putt, 40 feet maybe. And it's a pretty good effort, sliding four feet past on the right. He pops in the par putt, the only man in the group not to drop a stroke at this difficult hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T13:30:46.058+01:00"&gt;8.30am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;All three of the morning marquee group clatter their drives dangerously close to the scrub down the left. &lt;/b&gt;Only Kaymer escapes. A sign that this is his week? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Dufner has flayed his drive into deep abuse. Best round of the morning so far, and proof that there are scores out there early doors, is down to the soon-to-be-veteran Ken Duke: birdies at 1, 3 and 4, and he's -3 for his round through four holes. He's +2 having posted a distinctly average 75 yesterday, but this sort of carry-on offers succour to the chasing pack, and those who didn't have so great a day yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T13:24:52.387+01:00"&gt;8.24am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaymer makes no mistake with his birdie putt! &lt;/b&gt;Tempting fate, of course, but his putting stroke looks very metronomic and solid. That was right in the centre of the cup. The perfect start to the morning for the German. The commentators on US television have already uttered the phrase &amp;quot;McIlroy at Congressional&amp;quot;. It's unlikely that Kaymer will embark on a similar procession, if the USGA have anything to do with it, though you never know. Meanwhile Dufner gets up and down from the back with a lovely chip up the hill, while Bradley gets his par with a couple of safe putts. Elsewhere, De Jonge snaffles back the shot he dropped on the opening hole with birdie at 3. He's -2 again. This is what the very top of the leaderboard looks like now:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;-6: &lt;/b&gt;Kaymer (1*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-2: &lt;/b&gt;D Johnson (3*), de Jonge (3), Quinn, Na, McDowell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;-1:&lt;/b&gt; Stricker (3), Walker (3*), Bradley (1*), Molinari, Snedeker, Stenson, Kuchar, Todd, Spieth, Matsuyama&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T13:16:33.994+01:00"&gt;8.16am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dufner up first, sending his wedge into 10.&lt;/b&gt; And what a pin position! It's back right, with a small area to hold the ball up on. Dufner is about one bounce too long, and the bank at the back claims his ball, sending it skittering down the back. What a tricky up and down he'll have from there. Kaymer lands his ball pin high with a little backspin; it bites, and he'll have a 12-footer for birdie. What a start this could be for the leader. Finally Bradley, who plays it supersafe from 90 yards, coming up a good ten yards short. He's on the green, at least, unlike The Somnambulist, who to be fair might not have woken up yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T13:13:21.071+01:00"&gt;8.13am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An early birdie for Steve Stricker, who has the patience, moxie and most importantly the putting stroke to make an impact this weekend. &lt;/b&gt;He's -1. There are going to be a lot of times I'll be saying that today. He's -1. By way of illustration, the big South African, Bredon De Jonge, started out in second place today, but he's bogeyed 1. He's -1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T13:11:14.154+01:00"&gt;8.11am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The conditions should be favourable for the early starters today, before the temperature rises, and then temperatures rise. &lt;/b&gt;The upside-down-turtle greens will be a little softer, or rather not quite as baked as they'll get later. A fair bit of rain last night, so control should be a little easier until it dries out, at the expense of a little distance perhaps. In theory, the best scores should be made in the morning. But then look what Kaymer did yesterday. It's all about keeping your head, being patient, putting the ball in the right places, and holing those putts. Aggression doesn't always pay dividends: consider the scores of Rory (+1) and G-Mac (-2) yesterday, with the former relying on his raw talent to go for the pins, the latter grinding it out and playing smart. Dufner, Kaymer and then Bradley all send their second shots further down 10; Bradley's furthest ahead, and positioned best to pepper the flag. Birdies on their mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T13:06:03.220+01:00"&gt;8.06am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The leader Martin Kaymer is just about ready to tee off this morning, with his fellow PGA champions Keegan Bradley and Jason 'The Somnambulist' Dufner. &lt;/b&gt;They're not the first group out this morning by any means, mind, and we've had a couple of early movers. The most significant is the man pictured at the head of this fine report, the ever-entertaining Dustin Johnson. He's battered his way down the long par-five 10th, and birdied it. He's now in a tie for second with Kevin Na, Graeme McDowell, and the big surprise package, the 49-year-old journeyman Fran Quinn. Early birdies too for Mark Wilson, Jimmy Walker, and Paul Casey, all at -1 now. Good to see Casey firstly isn't injured - he jiggered his dodgy shoulder coming up the 10th yesterday - and has gotten over that late-in-round double bogey which dropped him back to level par. But never mind that: the morning marquee group is out, and Dufner (+2), Bradley (-1) and Kaymer (-5) have all whistled drives down the track. It's on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-06-13T12:00:44.283+01:00"&gt;7.00am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For a while, Martin Kaymer appeared hell bent on throwing away this year's Players Championship.&lt;/b&gt; Pootling along the back nine serenely with a healthy three-shot lead over Jim Furyk, his progress was halted by a storm. And when he returned, it soon became clear his equilibrium had been knocked out of whack by the wait. With Furyk already in the clubhouse, feet up and waiting, Kaymer double bogeyed 15. Then at the famous island green at 17, he only just stayed dry with his tee shot, before fluffing a chip from the fringe. He was left with a 30-foot par putt, and only a one-shot lead. Not only because the lightness was fading fast did it start looking grim. But no matter. Kaymer dug into the old reserves. He drained the par putt, then played 18 in the solid style to prevail by one stroke. He'd battled to come through, and had the unofficial &amp;quot;fifth major&amp;quot; in his bag, alongside the PGA Championship he'd already won back in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Of course we already knew he had &lt;i&gt;der Hoden&lt;/i&gt;, because he'd sunk the winning putt at the Miracle of Medinah in 2012, when his game and his confidence were in tatters. &lt;/b&gt;But the former world number one &lt;i&gt;really is&lt;/i&gt; back now, as yesterday's near-faultless 65, an opening round of steely-eyed wonder around a stunning (and stunningly difficult) golf course, proved. Field, watch out! Give this man a three-shot head start at your peril!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/13/us-open-2014-second-round-live-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663828/s/3b7792e1/sc/13/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119659150/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7792e1/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119659150/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7792e1/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119659150/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7792e1/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119659150/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7792e1/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119659150/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7792e1/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119659150/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7792e1/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119659150/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7792e1/sc/13/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/199119659150/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7792e1/sc/13/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/199119659150/u/0/f/663828/c/34708/s/3b7792e1/sc/13/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport">Sport</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/us-sport">US sports</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/us-open-golf-2014">US Open Golf 2014</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/golf">Golf</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/usopengolf">US Open</category><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2014 19:30:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/13/us-open-2014-second-round-live-report</guid><dc:creator>Scott Murray</dc:creator><dc:date>2014-06-13T19:30:17Z</dc:date><media:content height="276" lang="" width="460" url="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402677396699/b4dc78f0-ee8e-41b5-b1e9-752e035a44df-460x276.jpeg"><media:credit scheme="urn:ebu">Tannen Maury/EPA</media:credit><media:description>Martin Kaymer hits from another fairway.

His new book is no&amp;nbsp;exception and has led to, er, mixed reviews and accusations of&amp;nbsp;bigotry. So is he? A bigot?&lt;p&gt;Rod Liddle insists he's misunderstood. The Sunday Times columnist, controversialist, former revolutionary, ex-punk and long-gone editor of Radio 4's Today Programme says people always bang on about him being a rightwinger, whereas in fact he's a hero of the left. Now to make matters worse, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/22/selfish-whining-monkeys-rod-liddle-review" title=""&gt;Will Self has only gone and reviewed his new book for this very organ&lt;/a&gt; and suggested Liddle might be&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;tad racist. Liddle is seething in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;quiet, matey, if astonishingly foul-mouthed way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Selfish Whining Monkeys: How We&amp;nbsp;Ended Up Greedy, Narcissistic and Unhappy, he rants about capitalism, the internet, language police, the Guardian of course, political correctness gone MAD, broken families, inequality. And most of all, he rants about the liberal elite he claims runs the country. The real enemy within, he says, is this bunch what he calls the &lt;em&gt;bien-pensants&lt;/em&gt;, the faux left, who never have to deal with the downside of immigration, and simply benefit from the cheap labour and pretty eastern-European nannies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/13/rod-liddle-im-not-a-bigot"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663828/s/3b7b2c15/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture">Culture</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/media/media">Media</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/media/radio">Radio industry</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/books/books">Books</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc">BBC</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics">Politics</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/media/rod-liddle">Rod Liddle</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk">UK news</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/media/radio4">Radio 4</category><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2014 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/13/rod-liddle-im-not-a-bigot</guid><dc:creator>Simon Hattenstone</dc:creator><dc:date>2014-06-13T19:00:00Z</dc:date><media:content height="276" lang="" type="image/jpeg" width="460" url="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402680487560/Rod-Liddle-on-the-Today-p-009.jpg"><media:credit scheme="urn:ebu">Jeff Overs/BBC</media:credit><media:description>Part of the liberal elite at the Today programme?

By the time Alastair Cook pulled the plug, a further 231 runs had been added at getting on for a run a ball, Joe Root had reached a double hundred, and the lower order had gorged themselves on a flagging attack that nevertheless remained unbowed by the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the mid-afternoon point, Angelo Mathews bowlers were on their knees, so it was to Sri Lankas credit that they too put bat firmly to ball, fairly rattling along, although Chris Jordan did stall things by taking his maiden Test wicket with his third delivery. But at the close Sri Lanka had reached 140 for one, still 236 runs short of avoiding even the prospect of a follow-on, although given the nature of back-to-back Tests nowadays it would an option increasingly unlikely to be taken, despite the Kiwis bucking the trend and winning handsomely in Jamaica earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/13/joe-root-double-hundred-england-sri-lanka"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663828/s/3b7acf3f/sc/13/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport">Sport</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sri-lanka-in-england-2014">Sri Lanka in England 2014</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-cricket-team">England cricket team</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sri-lanka-cricket-team">Sri Lanka cricket team</category><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2014 18:34:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/13/joe-root-double-hundred-england-sri-lanka</guid><dc:creator>Mike Selvey at Lord's</dc:creator><dc:date>2014-06-13T18:34:03Z</dc:date><media:content height="276" lang="" width="460" url="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402684177319/BESTPIX-England-v-Sri-Lan-011.jpg"><media:credit scheme="urn:ebu">Harry Engels/Getty Images</media:credit><media:description>England's Joe Root celebrates reaching his double century against Sri Lanka at Lord's.

Iraqis themselves must chart a new course if the state is to survive&lt;p&gt;On 10 June, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/12/iraq-isis-kirkuk-baghdad-kurdish-government" title=""&gt;Isis&lt;/a&gt;), the group whose dramatic advances have startled the world over the past 72 hours, posted a photograph of their fighters demolishing barriers marking the dividing line between Syria and Iraq. They were, they claimed, &amp;quot;smashing the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement" title=""&gt;Sykes-Picot&lt;/a&gt; border&amp;quot;. This was a reference to the British diplomat Sir Mark Sykes and his French counterpart, Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Georges-Picot who, in May 1916, concluded secret negotiations to divide the Middle East into French and British zones of imperial influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isis's symbolic destruction of the border was an attempt to give credence to its claim to be sweeping away the false states created by the nefarious European powers, uniting all Muslims in one pious&amp;nbsp;community. Somewhat more surprisingly, this radical attempt at political engineering has also found sympathy among policy pundits in Europe and the United States who are looking for instant solutions to the long-term problems that are destabilising the countries of the region. Iraq and Syria, they argue, are prefabricated states that have never gained the loyalty of their populations. Popular political legitimacy will only be found in smaller, more religiously and ethnically homogenous units that mirror the provinces used by the Ottoman empire to administer the region before 1914.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/13/iraq-isis-terrible-decisions-2003-new-course-state-survive"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663828/s/3b7a9e16/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa">United States</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast">Middle East and North Africa</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usforeignpolicy">US foreign policy</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/world/world">World news</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis">Isis</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq">Iraq</category><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2014 18:28:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/13/iraq-isis-terrible-decisions-2003-new-course-state-survive</guid><dc:creator>Toby Dodge</dc:creator><dc:date>2014-06-13T18:28:58Z</dc:date><media:content height="276" lang="" type="image/jpeg" width="460" url="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402680472360/Iraqi-army-troops-in-Bagh-011.jpg"><media:credit scheme="urn:ebu">Ali Al-Saadi/AFP/Getty Images</media:credit><media:description>Iraqi army troops chant slogans against Isis outside a recruiting centre in Baghdad on 13 June 2014.

And now some say it has done precisely that, recently fooling a number of judges by successfully impersonating a 13-year-old boy. Not that this thing popped round to drink Coke, watch the football and swear at the referee. The test is nothing more than a five-minute exchange of texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is light years away from a computer &amp;quot;being human&amp;quot;. To do that, claimed sci-fi author Philip K Dick, it would need to look like us, walk and talk and act like us, and successfully mimic our emotional and empathetic responses. In Bladerunner, that cult 1982 classic based on a Dick short story, Harrison Ford's job is to track down and &amp;quot;retire&amp;quot; rogue replicants. The existential problems begin when he falls in love with one of them.

She first made an impression in A Raisin in the Sun (1959), Lorraine Hansberry's groundbreaking Broadway drama, which coincided with the rise of the American civil rights movement. In the play, about a down-at-heel black family seeking a better life in a segregated section of Chicago, Dee played Ruth Younger, Sidney Poitier's level-headed, long-suffering wife. She repeated the role in the film version two years later, for which she won the National Board of Review award for best supporting actress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had taken her over 20 years in theatre and films to gain such recognition. From the early 1940s, Dee had appeared in productions of the American Negro Theatre (ANT), other members of which were Poitier, Harry Belafonte and &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/08/guardianobituaries.film1" title=""&gt;Ossie Davis&lt;/a&gt;, whom Dee was to marry in 1948. It was an ANT production of Philip Yordan's all-black play Anna Lucasta, in which she starred on Broadway (taking over from Hilda Simms) in 1944.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/13/ruby-dee"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663828/s/3b7a5b54/sc/8/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa">United States</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/world/race">Race issues</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture">Culture</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/world/world">World news</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio">Television &amp; radio</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/television">Television</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/law/law">Law</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/stage">Stage</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre">Theatre</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/film/film">Film</category><category domain="http://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights">Human rights</category><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2014 17:33:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/13/ruby-dee</guid><dc:creator>Ronald Bergan</dc:creator><dc:date>2014-06-13T17:33:47Z</dc:date><media:content height="276" lang="" type="image/jpeg" width="460" url="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/13/1402676835461/ruby-dee-011.jpg"><media:credit scheme="urn:ebu">John D.
